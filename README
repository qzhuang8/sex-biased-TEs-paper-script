READAME 

This collection is to generate figures used in the sex-biased TE paper. 

Preprocessed files have been saved in the rds folder and most subpanels of figures 
can be generated with the script. Exceptions are the ones directly plotted with 
precalculated stats/numbers. Such as some bar plots. 

The main script to reproduce main figures is Paper_figure_script.Rmd. To use the script, download and modify the directory to local folder accordingly. 
We also include scripts (Figure1_intermediate_files et. al.) that create intermediate files used in Paper_figure_script.Rmd. 
Some intermediate files required high computing resources to be generated on a laptop/desktop. We directly include such intermediate files generated on cluster instead. 
Note: the mm10_rmsk_TE_strand_label.zip file in the intermediate_files_prep/Figure3/ folder will need to be unzipped before being used. The original file was larger than 100Mb that it has to be compressed to enable uploading.
