READAME 

This collection is to generate figures used in the sex-biased TE paper. 

Preprocessed files have been saved in the rds folder and most subpanels of figures 
can be generated with the script. Exceptions are the ones directly plotted with 
precalculated stats/numbers. Such as some bar plots. 

To use the script, download and modify the directory to local folder accordingly.
